# HaveIBeenPwned
Java client implementation for the "have i been pwned?" REST API service.

This is a basic implementation of the API, go to https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2 to check how it works.

Currently, it has been tested only in a standalone environment, using Java 8 on a Windows 10 machine.

It has NOT been tested in a container that already has a Jax-RS implementation.

If there is demand, I will try to make sure it works in a variety of environments.

To see how the API works, check the HIBPMain java file.

For JSON POJO classes, http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/ has been used.
